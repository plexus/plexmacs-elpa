Give Clojure/ClojureScript buffers the name of the Clojure namespace, rather

Run `(clj-ns-name-install)' to add function advice to activate this package.

Note: since walkclj is not on MELPA yet it's not being listed as a dependency
here, look at the plexus-clojure-extras layer to see how to ensure all
dependencies are there.
